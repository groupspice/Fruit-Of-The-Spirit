<noscript> Leader’s Notes4. Humanity began in a garden planted by God for our sustenance and growth. We were intended to live in that paradise forever.5. The fruit of the garden was intended for food to enable the growth and health of humanity. God included life-sustaining water and plant life to keep our air breathable.6. Humankind was placed in a perfect setting and set up for a test of obedi- ence. The description of the garden with its trees and river leads up to the command, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die” (vv. 16–17). From the very beginning of time, humankind was designed to do God’s will.7. Adam was placed in the Garden to work it—to take care of it. Whatever work Adam did was in service to God. Man’s purpose, then, is to serve God.8. A mind  lled with knowledge of the will of God comes through spiritual wisdom and understanding. This spiritual wisdom and understanding pro- duces in us a life worthy of the Lord. We bear fruit that glori es the Father; we grow in the knowledge of God; we are continually being strengthened with all power; and  nally, knowledge of God, his promises and purposes, gives us the strength we need to endure trials and su ering.9. When we let God be the gardener, the fruit that grows from our lives is used by him for his purposes. God plants the Spirit in us when we receive Jesus as our Lord and Savior. The Spirit produces fruit in us according to God’s purpose for us.12. Humans were created with the capacity for spiritual growth as well as physical growth. Paul recognized our part in our spiritual growth while acknowledging that God is ultimately responsible for the success.13. Paul calls the work of the Spirit in us the “fruit of the Spirit.” The fruit of the Spirit is the fruit that the Spirit of God produces in believers. But what does that mean? What is the Spirit? The Spirit of Christ is given as a gift to every Christian when we turn from our sins and trust Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.14. To help us grow, God places his Spirit in us to change us and grow us and produce fruit through us. To be “in Christ” refers to our identi cation with him in his life, death, and resurrection. He becomes our mediator and replacement.15. Our lives produce the fruit of the Spirit.110 </noscript>
