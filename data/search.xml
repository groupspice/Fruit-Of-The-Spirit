        <text><![CDATA[READ ME FIRSTWelcome to the Deepening Life Together study on Fruit of the Spirit. For some of you, this might be the  rst time you’ve connected in a small group community. We want you to know that God cares about you and your spiritual growth. As you prayerfully respond to the principles you learn in this study, God will move you to a deeper level of commitment and intimacy with himself, as well as with those in your small group.We at Baker Books and Lifetogether Publishing look forward to hearing the stories of how God changes you from the inside out during this small group experience. We pray God blesses you with all he has planned for you through this journey together.For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.Psalm 100:5Session OutlineMost people want to live a healthy, balanced spiritual life, but few achieve this by themselves. And most small groups struggle to balance all of God’s purposes in their meetings. Groups tend to overempha- size one of the  ve purposes, perhaps fellowship or discipleship.9]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstRarely is there a healthy balance that includes evangelism, minis- try, and worship. That’s why we’ve included all of these elements in this study so you can live a healthy, balanced spiritual life over time.A typical group session will include the following:Memory VersesFor each session we have provided a Memory Verse that emphasizes an important truth from the session. This is an optional exercise, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of  ll- ing our minds with God’s Word. We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING with God’s Family (Fellowship)The foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection with God and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn your trust provide a place to experience the life Jesus invites you to live. This section of each session typically o ers you two activities.You can get to know your whole group by using the icebreaker question, and/or you can check in with one or two group members— your spiritual partner(s)—for a deeper connection and encourage- ment in your spiritual journey.DVD Teaching SegmentA Deepening Life Together: Fruit of the Spirit Video Teaching DVD companion to this study guide is available. For each study session, the DVD contains a lesson taught by Tim Theule. If you are using the DVD, you will view the teaching segment after your Connecting dis- cussion and before your group discussion time (the Growing section).GROWING to Be Like Christ (Discipleship)Here is where you come face-to-face with Scripture. In core passagesyou’ll explore what the Bible teaches about the topic of the study. 10]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstThe focus won’t be on accumulating information but on how we should live in light of the Word of God. We want to help you apply the Scriptures practically, creatively, and from your heart as well as your head. At the end of the day, allowing the timeless truths from God’s Word to transform our lives in Christ is our greatest aim.DEVELOPING Your Gifts to Serve Others (Ministry)Jesus trained his disciples to discover and develop their gifts to serve others. And God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in a way no other person can. This section will help you discover and use your God-given design. It will also encourage your group to discover your unique design as a community. In this study, you’ll put into practice what you’ve learned in the Bible study by taking a step to serve others. These simple steps will take your group on a faith journey that could change your lives forever.SHARING Your Life Mission Every Day (Evangelism)Many people skip over this aspect of the Christian life because it’s scary, relationally awkward, or simply too much work for their busy schedules. But Jesus wanted all of his disciples to help outsiders con- nect with him, to know him personally. This doesn’t mean preaching on street corners. It could mean welcoming a few newcomers into your group, hosting a short-term group in your home, or walking through this study with a friend. In this study, you’ll have an op- portunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SURRENDERING Your Life for God’s Pleasure (Worship)God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in prayer and worship. You may read a psalm together, share a page in your jour- nal, or sing a song to close your meeting. If you have never prayed aloud in a group before, no one will pressure you. Instead, you’ll experience the support of others who are praying for you.11]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstStudy NotesThis section provides background notes on the Bible passage(s) you examine in the Growing section. You may want to refer to these notes during your group meeting or as a reference for those doing additional study.For Deeper Study (optional)Some sessions provide For Deeper Study. If you want to dig deeper into more Bible passages about the topic at hand, we’ve provided additional passages and questions. Your group may choose to do study homework ahead of each meeting in order to cover more bib- lical material. Or you as an individual may choose to study the For Deeper Study on your own. If you prefer not to do study homework, the Growing section will provide you with plenty to discuss within the group. These options allow individuals or the whole group to go deeper in their study, while still accommodating those who can’t do homework or are new to your group. You can record your discoveries in your journal. We encourage you to read some of your insights to a friend (spiritual partner) for accountability and support. Spiritual partners may check in each week over the phone, through e-mail, or at the beginning of the group meeting.Re ectionsOn the Re ections pages we provide Scriptures to read and re ect on between group meetings. We suggest you use this section to seek God at home throughout the week. This time at home should begin and end with prayer. Don’t get in a hurry; take enough time to hear God’s direction.Subgroup for Discussion and PrayerIf your group is large (more than seven people), we encourage you to separate into groups of two to four for discussion and prayer. This is to encourage greater participation and deeper discussion.12]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[INTRODUCTIONStories containing word pictures have been used throughout history to capture the imagination, bring ideas to life, invite contemplation and re ection, and challenge thought. One such story is the tale of the storyteller, Scheherazade, whose fables have been preserved in a work known as the Arabian Nights. The story of Scheherazade goes like this:Shahryar, king of Persia, upon discovering his wife’s in delity, has her executed and declares all women to be unfaithful. He then begins to marry a succession of virgins, only to execute each one the next morning. Eventually there are no more virgins to be found in the kingdom. With one exception. The daughter of the king’s political advisor, whose job it is to  nd virgins for the king to marry. Over the protests of her father, Scheherazade o ers herself as the king’s next bride.On the night of their wedding, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a story, but leaves the tale hanging, saying she will  nish it the next night. The king really wants to hear the end of the story, so he is forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the ending. The next night, as soon as Scheherazade  nishes the story, she begins a new one. Again, she leaves the story hanging, hoping to buy herself another day of life. The king, eager to hear the conclusion, post- pones her execution once again. As the story goes, this continues for 1,001 nights.13]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[IntroductionThe apostle Paul used word pictures in his epistles to help his hear- ers, and us, understand the things of God. The fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5:22–23 is one such word picture in Scripture designed to make us think. While Scheherazade told stories to save herself, Paul and the other writers of the Scriptures use word pictures to save oth- ers. They accomplish this by leading their readers to the knowledge of their Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Over the next six sessions, we will examine the meaning of the fruit in Paul’s word picture in Galatians 5:22–23 together.14]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SESSION ONEGOD’S PURPOSE FOR YOUMEMORY VERSE: But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is nolaw (Gal. 5:22–23).James loves to garden using a mix of colors and textures to bring out the natural beauty of the plants and landscape. One of his favorite things is tending to the many fruit trees he has planted around his property. Fruit trees provide beauty, shade, and the added bene t of great-tasting fruit, but growing them is not an easy task. They require a lot of tending. Even before he planted them, he had to consider location, soil, drainage, spacing between trees, and pollina- tion requirements. Then, once his trees were planted and growing, they continuously needed water, fertilizer, pruning, and protection against fungal and insect problems. It takes devotion to grow fruit trees, but with proper care and feeding they can live a long time and be very productive.James has a small collection of recently planted fruit trees that haven’t yet produced any fruit, but he’s anticipating it. He’s looking forward to getting apples from the apple trees, pears from the pear15]]></text>

Each tree will produce fruit in keeping with its kind as designed by God.In Galatians 5:22–23, the apostle Paul gives us a great word pic- ture to illustrate what the fruit of God’s Spirit will become once they mature. This is a powerful word picture loaded with meaning. In this session we will begin to unpack that meaning as we grow in understanding of God’s plan and purpose for the fruit of the Spirit in our lives.CONNECTING 10 min.Begin your group time with prayer. Ask God for open minds and willing hearts to receive his Word through this Bible study and for the courage to change as he challenges you in the weeks to come.Deeper relationships happen when we take time to keep in touch with one another. As you begin, pass around a copy of the Small Group Roster, a sheet of paper, or one of your study guides, opened to the Small Group Roster. When the roster gets to you, write down your contact information, including the best time and method for contacting you. Then, someone volunteer to make copies or type up a list with everyone’s information and e-mail it to the group this week.1. Begin this  rst session by introducing yourselves. Include your name, what you do for a living, what you do for fun, and any- thing else you would like to share.2. Whether your group is new or ongoing, it’s always important to re ect on and review your group values. In the Appendix is a Small Group Agreement with values most useful in sustain- ing healthy, balanced groups. Review these values and choose one or two—values you haven’t previously focused on or have roomtogrowin—toemphasizeduringthisstudy.Choosethose that will take your group to the next stage of intimacy and spiritual health. Discuss how you will implement these values in your small group.3. What about gardening do you  nd gratifying or satisfying? 16]]></text>

It is by his design and for his purposes that humanity was created and given everything needed to grow into people of God.God Created Humankind and Placed Them in a GardenRead Genesis 2:8–17.4. What was humanity’s  rst home like?Why do you think God made humanity’s home where he did?5. What is the purpose of the plant life and other things God placed in the garden?6. Why do you think God placed a tree in the garden that was o  limits (see the Study Notes for insight)?7. What does this passage say about why God created us (v. 15)?We Were Created for GrowthRead Colossians 1:9–11.8. What are  ve purposes that God ful lls in our lives as we grow in spiritual wisdom and understanding (vv. 10–11)?9. How do these purposes represent growth in our Christian lives?What is God’s part in this? Read 1 Corinthians 3:5–11.10. What is the seed that Paul refers to in verse 6?17]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Fruit of the Spirit11. What does this verse say about our responsibility as God’s children?12. What is our purpose in God’s plan?Recipients of the Spirit of GodRead Ephesians 1:13–14.13. What is the role of the Spirit in our lives, according to this passage?14. What does it mean to be included “in Christ”? How do we become included “in Christ”?Read 1 John 4:13–16.15. How do you think we can know that we have the Spirit of God within us?16. What is the ultimate purpose of our salvation and indwelling of the Holy Spirit in us, according to verse 15?Fruitfulness Is God’s Purpose for UsFrom the beginning of time, God’s purpose and plan for humanity has been to be fruitful and multiply (Gen. 1:28). Just like we want our garden to produce fruit (fruits, vegetables, foliage, or  owers), God desires that his garden produces fruit—fruit that is the result of our growth in these character qualities: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. God has given us the Spirit to make this happen. God is the master gar- dener for our growth; he is not  nished with us. He loves us as we are, but he’s intent on growing us into the people he desires us to be—people of character, people like Jesus.17. What character-building fruit have you experienced in your life lately?18]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[DEVELOPING10 min.God’s Purpose for YouDeveloping our ability to serve God as the Holy Spirit leads requires that we make time to let God speak to us daily.18. Which of the following next steps toward this goal are you willing to take for the next few weeks?t Prayer. Commit to connecting with God daily through per- sonal prayer. It’s important to separate yourself from the distractions in your life so you can really focus on commu- nicating with God. Some people  nd it helpful to write out their prayers in a journal.t Re ection. At the end of each session you’ll  nd Re ections Scriptures that speci cally relate to the topic of our study for the session. These are provided to give you an opportunity for reading a short Bible passage  ve days a week during the course of this study. Write down your insights on what you read each day in the space provided. On the sixth day, summarize what God has shown you throughout the week.t Meditation. Psalm 119:11 says: “I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.” Meditation is focused attention on the Word of God and is a great way to internalize God’s Word more deeply. One way to do this is to write a portion of Scripture on a card and tape it somewhere where you’re sure to see it often, such as your bathroom mirror, car’s dashboard, or the kitchen table. Think about it as you get dressed in the morning, when you sit at red lights, or while you’re eating a meal. Re ect on what God is saying to you through his words. Consider using the pas- sages provided in the Re ections pages in each session. As you meditate upon these Scriptures, you will notice them beginning to take up residence in your heart and mind.SHARING 10 min.

Jesus wants all of his disciples to help others connect with him, to know him personally. In the weeks to come, you’ll be asked to identify and share with people in your circle of in uence who need to know Jesus or need to connect with him through a small group community. With this in mind, as you go about your day-to-day activities this week, pay special attention to the people God has placed in your life. There may be co-workers, family or friends, other parents at school or sporting events that you see or talk to on a regular basis. When we meet next time, we’ll talk about how to help connect believers to Chris- tian community and begin sharing Jesus with those who don’t yet know him.SURRENDERING 10 min.Jeremiah 29:13 says, “You will seek me and  nd me when you seek me with all your heart.” God promises to be there for us when we yield our hearts fully to him. Each week you will have a chance to surrender your hearts to God in worship and prayer.20. Consider some di erent ways to worship that might  t your group. Following are a few ideas. Spend a few minutes wor- shiping God together.t Have someone use their musical gifts to lead the group in a worship song. You might sing a simple chorus a cappella, with guitar/piano accompaniment, or with a worship CD.t Read a passage of Scripture aloud together, making it a time of praise and worship as the words remind you of all God has done for you. Choose a psalm or other favorite verses.t Spend a few minutes praising God aloud. You may highlight some of the attributes of God’s character or praise him for speci c circumstances in your life.20]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="18">
        <text><![CDATA[God’s Purpose for You21. Every believer should have a plan for spending time alone with God. Your time with God is personal and re ects who you are in relationship with him. However you choose to spend your time with him, try to allow time for praise, prayer, and reading of Scripture. Re ections are provided at the end of each session for you to use as part of your daily time with God. These will o er reinforcement of the principles you are learning, and develop or strengthen your habit of time alone with God throughout the week.22. Before you close your group in prayer, answer this question: “How can we pray for you this week?” Write prayer requests on your Prayer and Praise Report and commit to praying for each other throughout the week. Close in prayer, asking God to encourage each participant to embrace the fruit of the Spirit and begin to live them out daily.Study NotesTree of the knowledge of good and evil: This tree signi es the giving of knowledge of good and evil. In contrast to the tree of life, eating of this tree would ultimately lead to death. The knowledge referred to is moral knowledge (discernment). Since God created Adam and Eve, they already possessed the moral discernment given them from God. In eating from the tree, they were disobeying God and therefore gained an understanding of evil, which is disobedience. If Adam had not disobeyed God, he would never have come to know evil. It was not therefore a “power” imbued by the tree that gave this knowledge but the act of disobedience in eating from it.21]]></text>

Pay close attention to the italicized phrases.On a sheet of paper or in your journal, note what these passages say (just the facts), what they mean (what can be implied from the text), and what they might mean to you. Once you have completed this for each passage, identify what you think the point is of Psalm 92:12–14.12The righteous will  ourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon;13planted in the house of the Lord, they will  ourish in the courts of our God.14They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh and green.ReflectionsReading, re ecting, and meditating on the Word of God is essential to getting to know him deeply. As you read the verses each day, give prayerful consideration to what you learn about God, his Spirit, and his place in your life. Then record your thoughts, insights, or prayer in the Re ect section below the verses you read. On the sixth day, record a summary of what you learned over the entire week through this study.Day 1.

        <text><![CDATA[FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSWhat do we do on the  rst night of our group?Like all fun things in life—have a party! A “get to know you” co ee, dinner, or dessert is a great way to launch a new study. You may want to review the Small Group Agreement and share the names of a few friends you can invite to join you. But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we  nd new members for our group?This can be challenging, especially for new groups that have only a few people or for existing groups that lose a few people along the way. Pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another strategy is to ask church leaders to announce that your group is open to new members.No matter how you  nd members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new lead- ers, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too small, it could be at risk of shutting down. If you and your group stay open, you’ll be amazed at the people God sends your way. The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their  rst six months, but every other week can work as well. We recommend that the group meet for the  rst six months on a weekly basis if possible. This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting, they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide whether heorshewantstocontinueonforanotherstudy.Somegroupslaunch77]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Frequently Asked Questionsrelationships that last for years, and others are stepping-stones into another group experience. Either way, enjoy the journey.What if this group is not working for me?Personality con icts, life stage di erences, geographical distance, level of spiritual maturity, or any number of things can cause you to feel the group doesn’t work for you. Relax. Pray for God’s direc- tion, and at the end of this study decide whether to continue with this group or  nd another. You don’t buy the  rst car you look at or marry the  rst person you date, and the same goes with a group. Don’t bail out before the study is  nished—God might have some- thing to teach you. Also, don’t run from con ict or prejudge people before you have given them a chance. God is still working in you too!Who is the leader?Most groups have an o cial leader. But ideally, the group will mature and members will share the facilitation of meetings. Healthy groups share hosting and leading. This ensures that all members grow, give their unique contribution, and develop their gifts. This study guide and the Holy Spirit can keep things on track even when you share leadership. Christ has promised to be in your midst as you gather. Ultimately, God is your leader each step of the way.How do we handle the child care needs in our group?This can be a sensitive issue. We suggest that you empower the group to openly brainstorm solutions. Try one option that works for a while and then adjust over time. Our favorite approach is for adults to share the cost of a babysitter (or two) who can watch the kids in a di erent part of the house. In this way, parents don’t have to be away from their young children all evening. A second option is to use one home for the kids and a second home (close by) for the adults. A third idea is to rotate the adults who provide a lesson or care for thechildreneitherinthesamehomeorinanotherhomenearby.This can be an incredible blessing for kids. Finally, the most common idea is to decide that you need to have a night to invest in your spiritual lives individually or as a couple, and make your own arrangements for child care. Whatever the decision, the best approach is to dialogue openly about both the problem and the solution.78]]></text>

Remember who is in control; the time to worry is when you’re not worried. Those who are soft in heart (and sweaty palmed) are those whom God is sure to speak through.Seek support. Ask your leader, co-leader, or close friend to pray for you and prepare with you before the session. Walking through the study will help you anticipate potentially di cult questions and discussion topics.Bring your uniqueness to the study. Lean into who you are and how God wants you to uniquely lead the study.Prepare. Prepare. Prepare. Go through the session several times. If you are using the DVD, listen to the teaching segment and Leader Lifter. Consider writing in a journal or fasting for a day to prepare yourself for what God wants to do.Don’t wait until the last minute to prepare.Ask for feedback so you can grow. Perhaps in an e-mail or on cards handed out at the study, have everyone write down three things you did well and one thing you could improve on. Don’t get defensive, but show an openness to learn and grow.Prayerfully consider launching a new group. This doesn’t need to happen overnight, but God’s heart is for this to happen over time. Not all Christians are called to be leaders or teachers, but we are all called to be “shepherds” of a few someday.104]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Session One God’s Purpose for YouConnecting1. Allow each participant to introduce themselves to the group. Whether your group is new or ongoing, there may be new people in the group who don’t yet have an established relationship with the group. New groups will need to invest more time building relationships with each other.2. A very important item in this  rst session is the Small Group Agreement. An agreement helps clarify your group’s priorities and cast new vision for what the group can become. You can  nd this in the Appendix of this study guide. We’ve found that groups that talk about these values up front and commit to an agreement bene t signi cantly. They work through con icts long before people get to the point of frustration, so there’s a lot less pain.Take some time to review this agreement before your meeting. Then during your meeting, read the agreement aloud to the entire group. If some people have concerns about a speci c item or the agreement as a whole, be sensitive to their concerns. Explain that tens of thousands of groups use agreements like this one as a simple tool for building trust and group health over time.As part of this discussion, we recommend talking about shared owner- ship of the group. It’s important that each member have a role. See Team Roles. This is a great tool to get this important practice launched in your group.Also, you will  nd a Small Group Calendar in the Appendix for use in planning your group meetings and roles. Take a look at the calendar prior to your  rst meeting and point it out to the group so that each person can note when and where the group will meet, who will bring snacks, any im- portant upcoming events (birthdays, anniversaries), etc.GrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.109LEADER’S NOTESSESSIONS]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notes4. Humanity began in a garden planted by God for our sustenance and growth. We were intended to live in that paradise forever.5. The fruit of the garden was intended for food to enable the growth and health of humanity. God included life-sustaining water and plant life to keep our air breathable.6. Humankind was placed in a perfect setting and set up for a test of obedi- ence. The description of the garden with its trees and river leads up to the command, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die” (vv. 16–17). From the very beginning of time, humankind was designed to do God’s will.7. Adam was placed in the Garden to work it—to take care of it. Whatever work Adam did was in service to God. Man’s purpose, then, is to serve God.8. A mind  lled with knowledge of the will of God comes through spiritual wisdom and understanding. This spiritual wisdom and understanding pro- duces in us a life worthy of the Lord. We bear fruit that glori es the Father; we grow in the knowledge of God; we are continually being strengthened with all power; and  nally, knowledge of God, his promises and purposes, gives us the strength we need to endure trials and su ering.9. When we let God be the gardener, the fruit that grows from our lives is used by him for his purposes. God plants the Spirit in us when we receive Jesus as our Lord and Savior. The Spirit produces fruit in us according to God’s purpose for us.12. Humans were created with the capacity for spiritual growth as well as physical growth. Paul recognized our part in our spiritual growth while acknowledging that God is ultimately responsible for the success.13. Paul calls the work of the Spirit in us the “fruit of the Spirit.” The fruit of the Spirit is the fruit that the Spirit of God produces in believers. But what does that mean? What is the Spirit? The Spirit of Christ is given as a gift to every Christian when we turn from our sins and trust Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.14. To help us grow, God places his Spirit in us to change us and grow us and produce fruit through us. To be “in Christ” refers to our identi cation with him in his life, death, and resurrection. He becomes our mediator and replacement.15. Our lives produce the fruit of the Spirit.110]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s NotesDevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.18. The intent of this question is to encourage group members to set aside some time to spend with God in prayer and his Word at home each day throughout the week. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a good Bible reading plan and commitment, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes a life. The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the session or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week after the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to see the importance of making time to connect with God a priority in their life. Encourage everyone to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.SharingJesus wants all of his disciples to help outsiders connect with him, to know him personally. This section should provide an opportunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.19. Encourage the group to observe their interactions during the coming week with the intention of using these observations next week in evaluating the people who God has placed in their lives that he might want them to share with or invite to small group.SurrenderingGod is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each session will pro- vide group members a chance to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship. Group prayer requests and prayer time should be included every week.21. Encourage group members to use the Re ections verses in their daily quiet time throughout the week. This will move them closer to God while rein- forcing the lesson of this session through related Scripture.22. As you move to a time of sharing prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of con dentiality and keeping what is shared in111]]></text>

Everyone must feel that the personal things they share will be kept con dent if you are to have safety and bonding among group members.For Deeper StudyWe have included an optional For Deeper Study section in most ses- sions. For Deeper Study provides additional passages for individual study on the topic of each session. If your group likes to do deeper Bible study, consider having members study the For Deeper Study passages at home between meetings.Session Two Attack of the FleshGrowing3. Walking by the Spirit means living continually by faith in Jesus, the Son of God who loved us and gave himself up for us. It means continually look- ing to Jesus and what he’s accomplished for us. It means always leaning on Jesus, who has so clearly demonstrated his love for us; and when we are captivated by his love, we will be changed by his grace, and the  esh will lose its power and allure.4. Many Bible translations use the term “ esh” in this passage when talking about the sinful nature all people possess. When we hear the word “ esh,” most of us think of our bodies. But that’s not what Galatians 5 means when it speaks of the sinful nature, or “ esh.” According to Scripture, our bodies are not bad. Our  esh is that sinful, sel sh part of us that seeks to build a life apart from God. The  esh sets its desires against the Spirit and vice versa. They are in opposition to each other.5. We are new creations in Christ, but we can choose to live either in the realm of the old age (in Adam), apart from God, or in the realm of the new age (in Christ). Paul helps us understand the di erence between our identi cation with Christ, as opposed to living in the power of the “ esh.”6. Some suggest to be “obvious” means that they are public and cannot be hidden, but a better conclusion is that they originate with the sinful nature and not with the new nature received at becoming a new creature in Christ and so are intrinsically known by all.8. These are immorality, impurity, sensuality, drunkenness, carousing (NASB). Self-indulgence or hedonism is one way we live our lives apart from faith, independent of God, by ourselves for ourselves.112]]></text>
